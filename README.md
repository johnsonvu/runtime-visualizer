# runtime-visualizer
A visualizer for analyzing Python code.

## Preview
Enter a Python project repository and the command to execute tests, then voila!

## Visualization Description
1. Our visualization was implemented using react-force-graph-2d
    * On top of this, we created customized rendering for node, and link metadata to display as an overlay 
    * To prevent clutter, we only display data on hover
        * The hovered node and its children are highlighted and their metadata is displayed

## Analysis Description

1. Function Call Graph â€” base graph shown in visualization
    * Using static syntactic analysis we grabbed all the name of functions
    * Using static lexical analysis, we look for function uses in each function of each file

2. Runtime Analysis â€” adds hover details and representitive edge widths to graph
    * Using static syntactical analysis, we determined where functions started and saved the name and make a call to our injected code to call our analyzeCode package
    * Using dynamic semantic analysis we ran tests that would trigger the injected lines of code naturally with reasonable inputs and save the data in a .json file to be processed later in JavaScript
    * Made a Python class to store our call information
    * Separate injections were made for test classes to  instantiate our code analyzer per test

3. Memory Analysis â€” adds node size to graph
    * Using static syntatical analysis, we find function definitions and inject code before each
    * For our dynamic analysis we run tests and lexically analyze the results from memory_profiler, tracking peak memory usage for each function call
